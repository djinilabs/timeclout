## Account & Access

### Q: "I forgot my password. How do I reset it?"

**A**: TimeClout uses Google OAuth for authentication, so you don't have a separate password. If you signed up with Google, just click "Sign in with Google" and use your Google account credentials. If you're having trouble, contact support@timeclout.com.

### Q: "Can I change my email address?"

**A**: Your email address is tied to your Google account. To change it, you'll need to update your Google account email, then contact support to update your TimeClout account.

### Q: "I have multiple Google accounts. Which one should I use?"

**A**: Use the Google account that you want associated with your TimeClout account. You can only be logged in with one account at a time, but you can switch accounts by logging out and signing in with a different Google account.

### Q: "Can I delete my account?"

**A**: Yes, you can delete your account. If you're a company owner, you'll need to delete the company first (which will remove all associated data). Contact support@timeclout.com if you need help with account deletion.

## Organization Setup

### Q: "What's the difference between a Unit and a Team?"

**A**: 
- **Unit**: A department, location, or division (e.g., "North Location", "Sales Department")
- **Team**: A specific work group within a unit (e.g., "Morning Shift", "Evening Shift")

Units are optional - you can create teams directly under a company if you don't need that level of organization.

### Q: "Do I need to create Units?"

**A**: No, Units are optional. They're useful for larger organizations with multiple departments or locations. If you have a simple structure, you can create teams directly under your company.

### Q: "Can I change my company name later?"

**A**: Yes! Company owners can update the company name in company settings at any time.

### Q: "Can I have multiple companies?"

**A**: Yes! If you manage multiple businesses or are a consultant, you can create multiple companies in your account and switch between them using the company selector.

## Scheduling

### Q: "How does auto-fill work?"

**A**: Auto-fill uses AI to automatically assign workers to shifts. It considers:
- Worker qualifications and availability
- Leave schedules
- Fairness (equal distribution of inconvenient shifts)
- Business rules (minimum rest periods, etc.)

Click "Start Auto-Fill" on your schedule, wait 2-5 minutes while it generates solutions, then review and apply the best result. You can stop it anytime you're satisfied.

### Q: "Can I adjust auto-fill results?"

**A**: Yes! Auto-fill creates a draft schedule that you can review and manually adjust. You can drag and drop workers, add or remove shifts, and make any changes before publishing.

### Q: "What if auto-fill can't find a solution?"

**A**: The system will show you which shifts are problematic (e.g., not enough qualified workers, too many conflicts). You can:
- Adjust shift requirements
- Add more team members
- Modify qualifications needed
- Create the schedule manually

### Q: "How do I create a shift?"

**A**: 
1. Navigate to your team's schedule
2. Click "Create Shift" or drag a template to a day
3. Set the shift details:
   - Date and time
   - Required qualifications
   - Inconvenience level
   - Shift name
4. Optionally assign a worker immediately
5. Save the shift

### Q: "Can I copy a shift to another day?"

**A**: Yes! Click on a shift and select "Copy" from the menu, then choose the day to copy it to. You can also drag shift templates to multiple days.

### Q: "What does 'publish schedule' mean?"

**A**: Publishing makes your draft schedule visible to all team members and sends them email notifications. Until you publish, changes are in draft mode and only visible to you (and others with write access).

### Q: "Can I undo changes after publishing?"

**A**: Yes! You can revert to any previously published version. The system keeps a history of all published schedules.

### Q: "What are shift templates?"

**A**: Templates are reusable shift definitions. Create a template once (e.g., "Morning Shift 8am-4pm") and drag it to calendar days to quickly create multiple shifts with the same settings.

## Leave Management

**A**: 
1. Navigate to your leave calendar
2. Click "Request Leave"

### Q: "What happens if I request more leave than I have available?"

**A**: The system will warn you, but you can still submit the request. Your manager will see the over-allocation and can decide whether to approve it.

### Q: "Can I see my team's leave calendar?"
