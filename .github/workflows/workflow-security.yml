          This PR modifies workflow files. Please ensure:
          
          1. ✅ All changes have been reviewed by a maintainer
          2. ✅ No secrets are being printed or exposed
          3. ✅ Path filters are in place for PR workflows that use secrets
          4. ✅ Permissions follow the principle of least privilege
          
          **Security Review Required**: This PR requires manual review from a repository maintainer before merging.
