# Contributing to TimeClout

We are thrilled you're interested in contributing to TimeClout! 🎉 Your help is essential for keeping it great.

We want to make contributing as easy as possible, but we have a few legal and community guidelines to follow.

## ✍️ The Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**This is the most important part.** Before we can accept _any_ code from you, you **must** sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

- **Why?** The CLA is a legal document that gives us (Gordon & Teixeira Lda.) the necessary rights to incorporate your work into our main product. It grants us a license to use your contribution in both our source-available version and our commercial SaaS. This is what allows us to run our business while building a great community. It also confirms that you are the original author of the work.

- **How?** It's easy! When you open your first Pull Request, a bot (CLA Assistant) will automatically post a comment with a link to sign the agreement. You only need to do this once.

We cannot legally merge a pull request from any user who has not signed the CLA.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug reports to new features.

### 🐞 Reporting Bugs

- Please check the [Issues](https://github.com/djinilabs/timeclout/issues) page to see if the bug has already been reported.
- If not, open a new issue. Be sure to include:
  - A clear and descriptive title.
  - Steps to reproduce the bug.
  - What you expected to happen.
  - What _actually_ happened (including error messages or screenshots).

### 💡 Suggesting Features

- Open a new issue to discuss your idea. This lets us coordinate and make sure it aligns with the project's goals before you spend a lot of time on it.
- Clearly explain the problem your feature would solve and how it would work.

### Pull Request Workflow

1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/djinilabs/timeclout.git`
